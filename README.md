#Analisis of Graphs:

#AQI Graph:
#The graph shows AQI Overtime during the time period 2018 â€“ 2021, we can see at the beginning of the data frame a reference of the behaviour of AQI pre-COVID. 
As we can see there is an all time low  in march 2020, when California declared state of emergency lockdown. So we can conclude that in fact quaratine had an important positive impact on AQI. However we can observe that this only lasted for a few months and then it started to begin to return to normal. Industries resumed activities during this time, while we remained in lockdown. Therefore we can also conclude that gas emissions from industrial activities have a much larger impact than human acitivites do. 

#PM2.5 Graph:
#In the graph shown we can see the measurments of PM2.5 during the time frame. We can see the behaviour of the emissions pre-covid. The first observation we want to focus on is the lowest point of hte graph which matches with the beggining of the COVID-19 lockdown. Another important observation we saw on this graph is the effects of the fires in California near the end of 2020. As we can see it reached an all time peak, not only once but almost three times during the data frame and we can see that it had repercusions on the emissions for the upcoming months. The graph ends up with a decrease in 2021. 

#NO2 Graph: 
As we can see on the graph it shows a pattern on the behaviour of NO2, it increases at the end/begining of the year during holiday season. We can also notice an all time high during the holiday season of 2019. Related to covid 19 quaratine we can see that it matches with the graphs lowest point, but it isnt as pronunciated as in the other gas emissions.
